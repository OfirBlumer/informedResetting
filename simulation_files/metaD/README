The following files are used for running MetaDynamics with LAMMPS with SR and ISR

normal_reset.py generates the files required for standard stochastic resetting

conditions_final.py generates the files required for ISR 

poisson.py generates the poisson distribution used in resetting

prepare_final.py is executed by normal_reset.py and conditions_final.py to generate the simulations files

The formats directory contains the generic input files for LAMMPS/Plumed

Modifications can be made to the files in the formats directory to change the stopping criterion etc. While modifications can be made to normal_reset.py and conditions_final.py to run simulations with different resetting rates and conditions
